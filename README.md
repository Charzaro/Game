# Game

A simple two person game played on one keyboard.

The goal is to shoot the opposing player's ship until they run out of health before you run out of health.
Each player has a primary fire, a speed boost, and two sub attacks. The key binds for each the controls
as well as which sub attacks the player is using can be customized in the main menu.

This is a large project I undertook one summer on my one. The goal was to create a fun game
to play with my younger brother in order to get him excited about coding. (Therefore it is
not too well organized and there are still many bugs)
